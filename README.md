# ROCK-PCA
ROtated Complex Kernel PCA for Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Earth Observation Data

This method is a conglomerate of different PCA-like well methods traditionally used in geosciences as EOF
with the purpose of finding spatio-temporal patterns that represents the main variational modes of geophysical variables, as described in:

D. Bueso, M. Piles and G. Camps-Valls, "Nonlinear Complex PCA for Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Global Soil Moisture," IGARSS 2018, Valencia, 2018, pp. 5780-5783. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8518155

Folder:
- ROCK-PCA: contains the main ROCK-PCA code.
- demo: contains a easy-to-use toy example to test and try the method.

Please, don't have any doubt to contact us for suggestions and remarks.
