# ROCK-PCA
ROtated Complex Kernel PCA for Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Earth Observation Data

This method is a conglomerate of different well know PCA methods traditionally used in geosciences as EOF.
The purpose is to find spatio-temporal patterns in a unsupervised way, that represents the main modes of variability of geophysical variables, as described in:

Folder:
- ROCK-PCA: contains the main ROCK-PCA code.
- demo: contains a easy-to-use toy example to test and try the method.

Please, don't have any doubt to contact us for suggestions and remarks.
